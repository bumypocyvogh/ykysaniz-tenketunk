A teen girl seeking retribution against her backstabbing former best friend finds her plans slightly derailed once she catches the eye of a familiar, handsome marquess. Bestselling author Amalie Howard delivers a delightful, anti-historical Regency-era romp thatâ€™s Bridgerton meets The Count of Monte Cristo!

 Lady Ela Dalvi knows the exact moment her life was forever changedâ€”when her best friend, Poppy, betrayed her without qualm over a boy, the son of a duke. She was sent away in disgrace, her reputation ruined.

 Nearly three years later, eighteen-year-old Ela is consumed with bitterness and a desire for . . . revenge. Her enemy is quickly joining the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of high society while she withers away in the English countryside.

 With an audacious plan to get even, Ela disguises herself as a mysterious heiress and infiltrates Londonâ€™s elite. But when Ela reunites with the only boy sheâ€™s ever loved, she begins to question whether vengeance is still her greatest desire.

 In this complicated game of real-life chess, Ela must choose her next move: Finally bring down the queen or capture the kingâ€™s heart?
